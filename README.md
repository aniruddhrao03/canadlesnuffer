##Candle Snuffer Project

Welcome to the Candle Snuffer Project! This project aims to create an automated candle snuffer mechanism using various technologies and programming languages.

##Features:
Automated Snuffing: The candle snuffer mechanism is designed to automatically extinguish candles when necessary, enhancing safety and convenience.
Sensor Integration: Ultrasonic and gyro sensors are integrated to detect the presence of a flame and determine the optimal time for snuffing.
Solidworks Design: Gear and ladder mechanisms are meticulously designed using Solidworks, ensuring precise movement and control.
RobotC Programming: The functionality of the candle snuffer is programmed using RobotC, facilitating efficient operation and responsiveness.
